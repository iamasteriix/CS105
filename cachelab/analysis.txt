1. The cache datablock has a capacity of 256 bytes and can therefore host 64 four-byte
integers. Both vectors of length 2 carry a total of 4 integers and so after the first
miss, all four integers can be stored in cache for a total of 4 calls. The cache hit
rate/cache miss rate ratio is therefore 3:1, which is why the values we get are correct.

2. The hit rate goes up, up to some point, as the vectors get longer because a 256 byte
datablock can store up to 64 integers in all 256 cache lines. Before this limit is
reached, the number of miss rate is constant for an increasingly more hit rates, which
brings the cache hit rate/cache miss rate up for increasingly longer vectors.

3. The cache hit rate for very large vectors drops because they exceed the cache size.
The operations drop off in performance since the processor has to retrieve data from
lower down the memory mountain, say, as far down as main memory.

4. Assuming that "not making the cache any bigger" means we cannot increase the cache
lines, one way to improve the cache hit rate for large vectors would be by increasing
the size of the datablocks to improve on spatial locality.
